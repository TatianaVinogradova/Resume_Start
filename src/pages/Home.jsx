        <ol>
                <li>1.5 years ago, my family moved from Moscow, Russia to Barcelona, and when I started learning a new language - Spanish, I realized that since fate had given me such a chance to start my life anew, I want to use it to the fullest and get a new profession. I chose the most interesting thing for myself - web development. I like to set up processes both from the inside - back end and from the outside - front end. </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris, a Soviet American programmer, had a huge influence on me. He recently had an
                interview, after which I began to study even harder. At the age of 68, he remains very erudite, he studies all his life, and solves many interesting problems. And I love learning and constantly learning new things, and this profession gives me this opportunity.
                </li>
                <p>
                </p><li>I have been working with a mentor for a year, he works at Deutschebank, his experience is more than 12 years. During this time, I have mastered the complete coding of a website from based on Ruby on Rails, - personal account with password, tabs, dashboards, adding photos, information, click-links. There is also a complete creation of a multi-page website based on React, with full content. So now I can be sure itâ€™s not just a hobby, I wanna work in this area. </li>
